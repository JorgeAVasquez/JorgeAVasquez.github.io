        A Little Bit About Me

    <p> <img src="Images/TIM.jpg" alt="Tim and Me" width="140" height="187">
        I am currently a sophomore at MIT.<br><br>
        I'm a Course 6-3 (Computer Science) major. However, I hope to declare a double major with 18 
        (Mathematics) this upcoming spring semester, as that's the soonest I'm allowed to, lol.
        <br><br>
        I am also a French minor! Bonjour!

        Research
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm currently working as an undergraduate researcher with the 
        <a href="https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/alfredo-alexander-katz-2/">Alexander-Katz</a>
        group at MIT. My contributions revolve around software development for one of the group's
        projects. The goal is to have motors autonomously respond to particles detected 
        through a live frame-by-frame feed and control their movements, this being aided by machine learning.
        <br> (Yay Neural Networks!)

    <h1 class="headers"> Interests </h1>
    <p> I like to work out. I'm also pretty big on podcasts. Although, I tend to only listen to the
        comedic ones. <br>
